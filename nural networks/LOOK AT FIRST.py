"""
this is the lerning algorithem i could add notes but im gowing to take out the atual nural networks 
stuff and note that the rest is just my bodged way of mixing my getwork code with my tick tack toe code
i belive i can make it better. if you skim throu you can see what function do by there names and edit
any values to see what would happen

it will out put a new set of wights and bias wich it will then see if better than old and repeat that
what it is printing the amount one lost tied and the new wigths and bias
